## üß© Demonstration

Below is a short demonstration of the encryption process running inside a safe virtual machine:

## üß≠ Overview

This project simulates how ransomware encrypts files using hybrid cryptography (AES + RSA).  
It provides a simple Windows Forms interface that lists affected files and includes a button to decrypt them once the private key is provided.

There is **no real payload, networking, or persistence**.  
The focus is understanding how file encryption and key handling work at a low level.

## üß© How It Works

### 1. Program Entry
- `Program.Main()` initializes application configuration and starts the main form (`Form1`).
- When the form loads (`Form1_Load`), encryption starts automatically, then the UI updates to show affected files.

### 2. Encryption Phase
- The public RSA key is loaded from embedded project resources (`Properties.Resources.publickey`).
- AES (256-bit) is used for symmetric encryption of each file in the local `./test` folder.
- Each file gets:
  - A **random AES key and IV**.
  - Both encrypted with the RSA public key (2048-bit) and written as the first 512 bytes of the output.
  - File contents streamed through a `CryptoStream` using AES.
  - The original file deleted after successful encryption.
- The process recurses through subfolders, skipping files already ending in `.encrypted`.

### 3. Decryption Phase
- When the user clicks **Decrypt**, the app:
  - Loads `privatekey.pem` from the working directory.
  - Imports it using `RSA.ImportPkcs8PrivateKey(...)`.
  - Decrypts AES key and IV from each `.encrypted` file.
  - Reconstructs the original file and deletes the encrypted one.

### 4. User Interface
- Displays a padlock image, a counter of encrypted files, and a fake ransom note text.
- A **Decrypt** button triggers the recovery process.
- Implemented via standard Windows Forms controls (`Label`, `TextBox`, `Button`, `PictureBox`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Language** | C# (.NET 6, Windows Forms) |
| **Crypto** | AES-256 for file data, RSA-2048 for key encapsulation |
| **Resources** | Embedded public key (`publickey.pem`), padlock icon |
| **UI Framework** | System.Windows.Forms |
| **I/O** | FileStream + CryptoStream for efficient block encryption |
| **Target** | Windows (x64) |

## üß™ Safe Testing

1. Create a `test` folder next to the executable.
2. Copy **dummy text files** only.
3. Run the program in a **virtual machine** (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V).
4. Observe new files with the `.encrypted` extension.
5. To decrypt, place `privatekey.pem` beside the executable and click **Decrypt**.
